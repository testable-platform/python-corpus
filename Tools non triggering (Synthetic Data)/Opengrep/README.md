Domain: net mending gauges

Keys on: files matching the language of a loaded rule, discovered by extension

Shape: real source, because this tool matches rule patterns against parsed source.

Nothing to report on it: Rules are language-scoped and pattern-specific. A single formatted return
  matches no rule in a security ruleset.

Contents: one minimal program per boundary family (py3.6, py3.7, py3.11, py3.13, py3.14). One class or one function, no branching, no duplication, no dependency, no dead export, no magic number. No manifest and no tool configuration, so nothing here is discovered as a project.

Expected: the tool runs and reports nothing.
