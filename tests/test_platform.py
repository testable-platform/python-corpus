"""The planted dependency pins must be genuinely importable.

A pin that nothing imports produces a manifest-versus-source disagreement that
looks like a tool defect and is not. This test is the guard against the
TypeScript corpus's structurally-zero-span trap reappearing here.

It also guards the reverse: paramiko 2.4.1 imports `six` WITHOUT declaring it.
On the Python 3.6 family that never showed, because cryptography 2.3 declared
six and supplied it by accident. cryptography 42.0.0 dropped six, so from 3.7
onward a runtime-only install raises ModuleNotFoundError. `six` is therefore pinned
explicitly in the support section of requirements-runtime.txt, and imported
here so the guard cannot rot.
