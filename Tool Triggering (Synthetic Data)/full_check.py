"""Cross-file consistency audit for branch PY-083.

Every rule here exists because violating it produced a wrong result somewhere
in this corpus or its TypeScript sibling. Two in particular:

  * NOTHING is compared against a hard-coded version literal. The TypeScript
    corpus shipped a full_check that asserted the digits "12" in engines.node
    and therefore reported a spurious FAIL on every branch of every later
    family. Here the expected interpreter is READ FROM .python-version and
    every other file is checked against that.

  * Expected values are read from the repository, never from a list baked into
    this script. The planted pins come from requirements-runtime.txt, the tool
    set comes from the Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/ tree, and the package name comes from the source
    layout.

Python 3.9 has no tomllib (3.11+) and this branch may have no third-party TOML
parser installed at all -- on the uv branches nothing can be installed. The
pyproject checks below are therefore deliberately line-based rather than a real
parse, and say so where that limits them.

Written 3.6-clean. Exit 0 = clean, 1 = at least one FAIL.

    This rule exists because it was violated for four consecutive family

    shipped a README whose opening line read "One branch of the Python 3.8
    family"; every repo-level `main` from 3.8 onward carried a section headed
    "Getting a Python 3.6 interpreter" with a CPython 3.6 tarball recipe; and
    requirements-dev.txt claimed on all four to have been "exercised on a real
    CPython 3.7.17 interpreter".

    The reason it survived is worth stating: the TEMPLATED fields around the
    prose were all correct. The branch id, the interpreter, the pins, the
    tables -- every substituted value was right, on every branch, which is
    what a reader checks. The frozen sentences sat between them.

    So the rule is not "spell-check the docs". It is the same rule the whole
    corpus runs on, turned inward: **a claim in prose is checked against the
    artifact it claims about, or it is not allowed to name a version at all.**

    Three checks:
      1. No file may name a Python version other than this branch's, unless
         the line is explicitly a cross-family comparison.
      2. Every "<distribution> <version>" pair in README prose must match that
         distribution's actual pin in this branch's manifests.
